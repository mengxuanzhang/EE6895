For this part, we scraped data from US policy page of financial times and the "currency" searching results of wall street journel.
Take the headline, timestamp, summary and first several paragraphs of the news as our data with "ftscrape.py" and "wsjscrape.py" file.
Then we do basic NLP works to find out the nodes of our Bayesian Network.
